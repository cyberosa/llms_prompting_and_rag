    "### Prompt engineering techniques\n",
    "Optimizing prompt engineering with large language models (LLMs) involves refining the input prompts to achieve better performance or generate desired outputs. Some common strategies for optimizing prompt engineering are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Experimentation and Iteration:**\n",
    "   - Start with a simple prompt and iteratively refine it based on model outputs.\n",
    "   - Experiment with different phrasings, structures, and lengths to find what works best.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prompt Tailoring:**\n",
    "   - Tailor prompts to the specific capabilities and limitations of the model.\n",
    "   - Adjust prompts to guide the model towards the desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Temperature and Top-k Sampling:**\n",
    "   - Adjust temperature and top-k sampling parameters to control the randomness and diversity of generated outputs.\n",
    "   - Lower temperatures (e.g., 0.5) produce more deterministic outputs, while higher values (e.g., 1.0) introduce more randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Prompt Engineering Libraries:**\n",
    "   - Leverage prompt engineering libraries designed for specific models, such as OpenAI's prompt-engineering for GPT-3.\n",
    "   - These libraries often provide pre-built functions and templates for effective prompt engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Domain-Specific Knowledge:**\n",
    "   - Incorporate domain-specific knowledge into prompts to enhance model performance on specific tasks.\n",
    "   - Guide the model with task-specific instructions or context.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Chain of thought prompting:**\n",
    "   - Combine multiple prompts or input sequences to provide a broader context or set of instructions.\n",
    "   - Concatenate relevant information to help the model understand the desired task more comprehensively.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Fine-Tuning:**\n",
    "    - Fine-tune the model on specific tasks or domains to improve performance.\n",
    "    - This requires access to labeled data for the specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Bias Mitigation:**\n",
    "    - Carefully design prompts to mitigate biases in model outputs.\n",
    "    - Consider using debiasing techniques or introducing counterfactuals to address potential biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Prompt Evaluation Metrics:**\n",
    "    - Establish clear evaluation metrics for generated outputs.\n",
    "    - Use these metrics to quantify the model's performance and guide prompt refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Prompt Setting:** \n",
    "    - Combine a structured set of tokens, that were used on the LLM during training, that elicit desirable responses from an LLM.\n",

    "When the problem of not getting good respones is a lack of specific relevant information (context) on the training data of the LLM, then a more efficient technique is using RAG. The RAG technique helps LLMs by giving them access to external data so that they can generate a response with additional context.\n",

The first prompt we tried included already instructions about the specific format of the desired output. We succeded in the way that the two models answered with the correct format but soon we realized that most of the answers are purely random.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models can sometimes make up events and facts that do not allign with reality because they are optimized to imitate human reasoning and not to say always the truth. Thus we cannot use the metric \"prediction accuracy\" here to guide our prompt engineering strategy. Using the same words as Andrew Ng:\n",
