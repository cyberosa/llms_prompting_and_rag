Nevertheless, we could represent the uncertainty using a range or interval based on the probabilities and some assumption of potential swing in team performance. For instance, considering the close probability values, a reasonable confidence interval could be something like [0.45, 0.59] for Rajasthan's win percentage or [0.41, 0.54] for Bangalore's win percentage. Please note that I cannot guarantee the validity of these confidence intervals, as cricket match outcomes include a significant element of randomness and uncertainty.\n",

That's why the model also provides a confidence interval, which in this case includes a lower bound of 55% and an upper bound of 71%.
