    "Zero-shot learning in NLP allows a pre-trained LLM to generate responses to tasks that it hasn’t been specifically trained for. In this technique, the model is provided with an input text and a prompt that describes the expected output from the model in natural language. The pre-trained models can use its knowledge to generate coherent and relevant responses even for prompts it hasn’t specifically been trained on. Zero-shot learning can reduce the time and data required while improving efficiency and accuracy of NLP tasks. Zero-shot learning is used in a variety of NLP tasks, such as question answering, summarization, and text generation."
